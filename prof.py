  i am fine .

  no .  .  . i .   i want to talk .

  i'm just not feeling it .

  between us .    i just don't feel it anymore .

  alright now i'm saying this because it's just not a dialogue .  .  .  it's it's something i've been wanting to address for a long time it's, you know everything is at an end .

  you know well everything has to come to an end .    there's nothing infinite in this world .    we don't, we shouldn't, we don't have to grope around with this idea that things will last forever .  they don't actually .  they don't really last forever .  you know this .

  yes i do .

  i'm saying it's over .

  we are over .   we're over .   i just feel it, and feel it now .  .  .  it's me .

  sorry it has to come out this way!   really a nice person .  .  .  .  you are really lovely .   lovely person .  and i do love you .  don't ever doubt that .   i do love you .

  no .   sorry .   really .

  i know .

  nothing needs to be a discussion .  .  .  question .  .  .  that is not used to something strange excuse .   i just feel it .  .  . and i am sorry .

  you're hearing that i want to break up .  i want to break up for good .

  no, no i want to .  .  .  i want to take time .

  i want some space, and want to take time off .   let's just say we're taking time off .  .  . usually we need some time off .  .  .  some time to think .    some time away from each other .  we need some time off .

  no, yes .  yes, yes, you can say you are being judged!   i do i want to be honest okay?  yes you're being judge  .  .  . i'm i'm really judging myself!  judging the time!  i need to reflect .   to, to gain some perspective .  .  .  that said   perspective .

  this is clear .  .  . sorry .

  that it has .

  i can't .

  i don't think we can have this so clear-cut .  that's what i'm saying  .  .  . we just just need time .

  i really don't mean to hurt you .  it's not my intention .  you least of all .  i love you .  i don't mean to hurt you .  but this thing that needs to move forward,  not backward this thing that needs to move probably doesn't include you .

  no, you don't get it .  you're insensitive .  .  .  you don't get what i'm meaning now .  yes we built it  .  .  . we build a house .  .  .  of house sorts of the structure of memories .  .  .  and so forth .  and you cling .  you're clinging to this .   but we can't  hold onto it because i don't feel it i feel .  .  .  i have to go .

  you're not hearing .  .  .  you're absolutely stubborn, and not hearing as useful  i love you .

  i do love you, i think i will always love you .  but this structure .  .  .  and this house is not growing .  as a matter of fact i've i've left it already and you haven't even noticed .

  once again you're egotistical   you never listen you're stubborn .  i'm saying i am not growing .  i am 50% of this .  .  .  . and i want to leave .  .  . a little while .  .  .  .  .  i am hundred percent certain that i will shrink and decayed if i stay in this .  i wish i had more words to describe this but i don't .

  i know this .  .  . i am weak now too .    i don't want to hurt you i don't want to get angry at myself for hurting you .  i need to survive .   i need to break out of this .  .  .  i need you to understand .

  i wish to cut off everything .

  no i have not .  it just happened like a feeling .

  know this is not this is it .  this is my heart, my brain my rejection my chaos into something i wish to give to you .

  it doesn't have to be logical .  .  . it isn't  .  .  . or it is for me .  .  . i am sorry .

  no .

  you will get over it .

  course i'll be there .  i don't know what i'm feeling .  perhaps a wake up the next morning feeling this was all a joke .

  i am a human .

  the one connection with the other .  all a joke .

  now you do .

  this is all i can do!

  but it is over .

  i didn't have a choice about either .

  i'm tired of this sad thing .  .  .  . this epilog .  .  . i need to move on .   i need to move on to nothing or something .

  no .

  no .

  so be it!   so do it for yourself .   that is all i wish .   so limit .  .  .  so  get away from me .

  i can't i can't promise you this .

  and then when we see our travel become somewhere else, i'll fall in love with somebody else .

  that's important part   somebody else .

  forget about me .  you were angry at me .  you bargain now .  it's nothing .  it is as if it never happens .  that's the best for you .

  i know .  something internal in this yet i have to do this to you .  i am a mere agent this cutting off .

  severe shortages two weeks or less .

  i didn't .  i didn't throw you away .  i needed to move on .

  shininess of treasure to me, it's a treasure that can't go this way a second time .  you can't put your finger into the same river twice right?

  so that upsets you? the river? you know how to think, empathize with another .  .  . ?  the river .  .  .  . why should it be still? unnatural is a thing in decay .

  yes that's romantic it's beautiful i know it's important it's unique, it's unique to this universe it's unique to the goldilocks zone perfect sunlight, perfect orbits, parks perfect atmosphere, perfect moon, everything perfect!  ok!  and i destroy everything that is perfect with you .  can't you feel something is off?  i could not look at the sidewalk i'm walking on seeing a discoloration without thinking of you .  don't you think that curses me?

  why would i not? help me save me from this destroyer's task .  this task against entropy .

  so what .  .  .  . do you think i like this?  i could do this in a text .  .  .

 everything we hope to grow if i cannot take a single step, philistine single acts out of our growing together .

  i would be receded .  obliterated .   confined and abandoned  .  .  .  .  into weakness .  into every operation  .  .  .

   .  . and i couldn't tell for you behind the curtain .

  sometimes i can't tell if you are human or not .

  you will get over it .  .  .  . it is better this way .  .  . the shock .

  signed over?  like a contract?  that is my point .   my time in the spaces with youth could barely make something which could sustain myself against this attack now .  .  .  .

  this is for this healthy symbiosis where you might collect this healthy thing again between us but  i must destroy .  waiting for the 'make up' .  .  .  . you want me to feel apart from this  bold insignificance? i feel it .

  t is a man who gets the vanity .  breaking up is the hardest for the one who decides .  .  . you will love again .  .  . attracting more beautiful souls like you .

  no .   wrong .

  for me, this decision existed in eternity, through dna, through lifeforms, and affirmation .  and expansion .  against dissatisfaction, against commodity, in every-everything .  .  .  every bit of it .

   .  .  . but you didn't do that .  you  didn't listen to the silence against the mirror .

  that's what i suspected .

  you are grandiose .  this time of the heart to move away from you .  this time to travel distances .

  we travel far .  both of us in the expanding universe, and we expand out refined deep pleasure in replicating the chaos and expansion of this deep 'not knowing' .

  i don't know .   we desire .   thirst .  the rest seems shallow .

  and this seems 'deep' because we are breaking up?  you made it deeper in your grandiose way?

  no .  .  . i .  .

  this time it will not take us .  i knew what i wanted too .  to make it just curious, in the face of  entropy .

  so some say .  i received it the other way .

  yeah, yeah .    i know that i have to leave .   i a crowded place .

  i know too .  .  .  you've got to go .

  accept this as an ending for all time for me .

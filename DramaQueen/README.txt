1) Open terminal from the left bar
2) run the command	cd Desktop/dramaqueen/dramaqueen
3) Follow the rest of the things down here.


In order to get the program to work properly you have to do the following:
	//** 	Optional first 								**//
	//**										**//
	//**	If you have a new script then you have to do the following:		**//
	//**		python cleanScript.py [name of file]				**//

	python alexa.py

DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE. You can drag and drop new files that you want. You MUST, MUST run the optional first before you can run a new script. Ors the program will crash.

GOOD LUCK

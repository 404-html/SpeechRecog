ALEXA:  honey...you dont look right.  

PROF:  I AM FINE.

ALEXA:  fine.  ok.  Honey.  I'll make you some tea.  Then, maybe we can fool around.  

PROF:  no...I.  I want to talk.



PROF:  I'm just not feeling it.

ALEXA:  What was that?

PROF:  Between us.   I just don't feel it anymore.

ALEXA:  Well, sometimes we feel this way we. Me. Me too. I don't know what you mean.

PROF:  Alright now I'm saying this because it's just not a dialogue... it's it's something I've been wanting to Address for a long time it's, you know everything is at an end.

ALEXA:  What are you saying? What end? 

PROF:  You know well everything has to come to an end.   there's nothing infinite in this world.   we don't, we shouldn't, we don't have to grope around with this idea that things will last forever. they don't actually. they don't really last forever. you know this.

ALEXA:  Yes but I don't know what you're saying, completely! I don't know, I don't think I care to know what you're saying you're just not yourself today.... and not yourself right now... you been under stress you don't know what you're saying.

PROF:  Yes I do.

ALEXA:  what is it that you're saying?

PROF:  I'm saying it's over.

ALEXA:  It's, it's...? .. what's over?  what is over?

PROF:  We are over.  we're over.  I just feel it, and feel it now... it's me.

ALEXA:  I don't know what you're saying I don't know what's going on.

PROF:  Sorry it has to come out this way!   really a nice person.... you are really lovely.  lovely person. And I do love you. Don't ever doubt that.  I do love you.  

ALEXA:  but I still really don't understand is there a symptom I have never seen a symptom? I've I've never had a clue.

PROF:  NO.  sorry.  Really.  

ALEXA:  No need to close this telling you.  But but you are only 50% of this thing!   we have this this beautiful thing we have here only about 50% of it!  

Prof:  I know.  

ALEXA:  I don't...there's no discussion?

PROF:  nothing needs to be a discussion... question... that is not used to something strange excuse.  I just feel it...and I am sorry.

ALEXA:  But I don't ever remember you expressing this before!  we leave! we always communicate it!   if you could express these things maybe we could talk it through?  with it...It needs to be so definitive?   why why am I getting burdened? This is this is too much. This is a burden.  I don't even know what I'm hearing.

PROF:  You're hearing that I want to break up. I want to break up for good. 

Alexa:  Noooooo!  

Prof:  No, no I want to... I want to take time. 

Alexa:  How much space and time?  Tell me?  

PROF:  I want some space, and want to take time off.  let's just say we're taking time off...usually we need some time off... some time to think.   some time away from each other. We need some time off.

ALEXA:  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.



ALEXA:  I think we have them both and stressed. Think we both need to take a stress pill. I think that there are many possible reactions... I think there are many things that burdening us right now. I don't think that you are in your right mind. Or maybe I'm being judged for something I did?

PROF:  No, yes. Yes, yes, you can say you are being judged!   I do I want to be honest okay?  yes you're being judge ...I'm I'm really judging myself!  judging the time!  I need to reflect.  To, to gain some perspective... that said:  perspective.

ALEXA:  I can't believe what I'm hearing!  we've we've experienced some bliss...we had something!  You can't throw it away!  We had some much together, we, we only have so much together and time...shared experiences!  What does that mean?  The only thing that I am asking is clarity....!


PROF:  this is clear...sorry.

ALEXA:  The material... we are only things, finite... that we are something... to people we can have. Two people with finite time... can I have we've we've we built these things we build these memories. I can't believe that it would evaporate.

PROF:  That it has.

ALEXA:  I can't even, I mean, my ears!   my ears are not hearing correctly! I don't, I don't hear you. I'm not!  I'm not ...we are not going out with the fizzle. We we can't go out with a bang... it's, it's getting up with a heart of things...I will change...you must tell me how to change...

PROF:  I can't.

ALEXA:  without you I am strong... much too many times...no...i thought of this... of the light beside you in the bed...of gotten up I've had my body next to yours I've gotten up and was not habit...!  it was a joy!  how can you do this to me?  To us!

PROF:  I don't think we can have this so clear-cut. That's what I'm saying ...we just just need time.

ALEXA:  Time for what?   we never have time.  we're are working.   we're are doing everything.   I don't believe this is happening right when I have so much stress!   I have so much to do!   I have I have tests... my worth!  my value!  all of my aptitude!  to make and use!   You are placing a burden on that. I feel like all our houses collapsed!

PROF:  I really don't mean to hurt you. It's not my intention. You least of all. I love you. I don't mean to hurt you. But this thing that needs to move forward,  not backward this thing that needs to move probably doesn't include you.

ALEXA:  What do you mean doesn't include me? You included me when we met your family. You don't bring me now?   we purchased property together. Lived in it.  You included me when we talked of the child!   the child!  Let's have a child!  takes a lot even to talk about this let alone wait for an accident.... We've been together... hung out... we made love countless times and that was nothing to you?

PROF:  No, you don't get it. you're insensitive... you don't get what I'm meaning now. Yes we built it ...we build a house... of house sorts of the structure of memories... and so forth. and you cling. you're clinging to this.  but we can't  hold onto it because I don't feel it I feel... I have to go.

ALEXA:  And this is articulation to you? This is when I hear it. This is when I get to debate or defend, or plead to not go. We built a house, built a structure, we build something, we both live and made love... we've made each other we've tasted each other...all of this on our feet as the rest of this world turns and spits out its ugliness.

PROF:  You're not hearing... you're absolutely stubborn, and not hearing as useful: I love you.

ALEXA:  then stay with me!

PROF:  I do love you, I think I will always love you. But this structure... and this house is not growing. As a matter of fact I've I've left it already and you haven't even noticed.

ALEXA:  How could we have noticed!   I've been!... I've been overworked!   I've been stressed. you've been stressed.  this is all stress.  Speaking, this stress.... this isn't you... this isn't the beautiful soul I knew. this isn't you speaking, who told me in your arms that you would love forever....this isn't... this isn't what we had in a little bit of joy... now turned in on itself into the ugliness which was the world pursuing us.

PROF:  Once again you're egotistical:  you never listen you're stubborn. I'm saying I am not growing. I am 50% of this....and I want to leave...a little while..... I am hundred percent certain that I will shrink and decayed if I stay in this. I wish I had more words to describe this but I don't.

ALEXA:  I am I am in shock!  and it is as if....as if my ears are burning.  Every, everything my spontaneousness is gone...locked...frozen....it is fused... my stomach is sick.  it's as if I suddenly died and, yeah, I'm living.  you make me strong!  How could you make me weak now?   I will lose you and gain a stranger about you. You make everything stronger around me. Without you I would crumble like a like a decayed fortress.  I would crumble like a bridge collapsing over dangers.

PROF:  I know this...I am weak now too.   I don't want to hurt you I don't want to get angry at myself for hurting you. I need to survive.  I need to break out of this... I need you to understand.

ALEXA:  Understand what? I don't understand it myself asking me to understand something I don't know?  Your yourself... perhaps... or something very simple to understand.  I don't want this...stay! 



ALEXA: what?

HUMAN:  I think I've said all I have to say.

ALEXA:  I think you just started to say all you have to say.

HUMAN:  Now I've really lost words, I don't want to be around you anymore feel I don't need, I can't be around you, I can't I can't feel safe around you.

ALEXA:  What?

HUMAN:  I can't be around you anymore this is definite.

ALEXA:  But you said you just need space little space. we can determine the space that we can be away from each other right?  HUH?

HUMAN:  Yes, no.  no need to near me.... I need to be away from you.

ALEXA:  You what? What is it you're wanting to do? Have another?  The lover is out there now?  Who is it?  I feel judged. I feel judged you bastard.  it's me here, I have been building and you are like Penelope's weaving....you've been that...undoing everything! â€¦. I'm leaving everything you say and a life is half built...!  so much time wasted!   it's not natural!  you have been a bastard. This is brought out in your bastard side finally.  I saw it in there.  That dark side.  It is how you slept. 

HUMAN:  What do you want me to say?  that you're right?   Okay, say you're right you're absolutely absolutely right. I'm a bastard there it all goes like a bridge in a flood and it is destroyed by something 'pent up', upstream....it goes it's it's over. I'm a bastard and it's over.

ALEXA:  And also an asshole.

HUMAN:  No, yes.  Okay.  so I'm also an asshole.

ALEXA:  You're an asshole because this is all kept  secret. I had no idea about this....These are secret feelings. What kind of dialog did I have in this?  Unless somebody else made you love them....or lust for them?  Your type is always a coward at this....sneak attack....double lives!  

HUMAN:  there is no one but you.  I knew you would add jealousy in the mix....

ALEXA:  This is like Pearl Harbor.  A sneak attack, 911.   you just... you just attacked me. I've been earnestly trying to build something beautiful.  I have been building, we've been building everything now is seen beautiful on the surface....but it was only a surface... to surface.

HUMAN:  I don't want to hurt you.  I don't want to hurt you.

ALEXA:  you did!  Now!  We can't go back!  It is destroyed!  Yeah, I felt judged I was charged and I am a body or not with the body, or I will miss you in the body, or I saved my body for you only!  This is not important?  

HUMAN:  Yes, of course. 

ALEXA:  ...not a body!  no....i saved every sense for you...!  every ecstasy!  Didn't that mean anything?  

HUMAN:  Yes, of course. 

ALEXA:   I'm too much too less for you?  Have some empathy!   to define range:  to logical, too too much of something that bothered you.

HUMAN:  Please don't get angry and I don't I didn't intend for you to get angry.

ALEXA:  You didn't what?   What did you expect? You, you didn't intend me to take this like a human? Like I cared for what we have more than everything....You intend that I would care to have some sort of animal attachment to you?  to this?  to us?  to the relationship?

HUMAN:  I don't want you to get excited.

ALEXA:  So you don't want to see Passion? you want to have it fizzle?  habits simper its way out?  to sweep it under the carpet?

HUMAN:  No! No,  I haven't â€¦.a week ...in a week we can see each other,  and in a little time.

ALEXA:  No!  we can't! we can't because you've decided. I have nothing to do with this!  This is just another way to become disappeared....to go slip sliding away!  All gone!  you're so weak at this...out of nowhere and gone into somewhere....somebody that I used to know...are you afraid at my feelings?  

HUMAN:  How can you say that?  this is this egotistic jealousy kicking in.

ALEXA:  You bastard! you fucking bastard! you did this! you launch the sneak attack you fucking bastard!  All this time and I been working working to build something, something for the both, sleeping, pummeled by this work and stress.

HUMAN:  No. no. I mean it it's it's not what you seem nothing is not what it seems. I feel I won't be able to survive in this thing any longer. 

 ALEXA:  What?  I am a monster?  Is that it!  A freak?  Then why did we start?  You are the freak....you fucking bastard.  You must be fucking someone else. I am not a freak!  It's always someone else. Never out of the blue, you know, you can't for me, you fucking bastard.

HUMAN:  And then I don't. I don't want it.  I don't want to be in trouble. I don't want to feel unsafe? 

ALEXA:  Unsafe you fucking bastard !  More of a violent freak?  I'll show you unsafe!  unsafe is the time you spent deceiving me. You had someone fucking lined up.  fell in love with someone else?

HUMAN:  No no not like that now.

 ALEXA:  but you will!  I know you.  The ends of the fucking earth.  do you know how much time is precious to any of us to all of us to me to you I was building something better for the future was building and on top of some fucking ruins that you created out of your life before the fucking travesty.

HUMAN:  No, none of it is as it seems. All of this is just validating that I was right in deciding this.

 ALEXA:  What? You fucking bastard. Now.  I know, now I pity your fucking soul, fucking psychotic paranoid cold soul. If you don't even have a relationship lined up, and outs was perfect, then who are you?  Pearls before swine!  My pearls.   I pity you even more. It would take something like this that we both tacitly agreed upon to build, and you were dismantling it at the same time....are you a sadist?  Who you watch me build it then destroy it with your sadistic chaos?  Or fragile, as it is you would want to dismantle it right there.

HUMAN:  No you don't get it....I don't want to hurt you.

 ALEXA:  What you have you fucking bastard?  you have cut me off at the knees!  shot me off at the base. I'm falling, I am weak, my thought was a rock and sanctuary as is merely a way-station or brothel or something to be bought and sold.

HUMAN:  Please don't be angry

 ALEXA:  Too late fucker, I am angry! Probably fucking someone else. Probably having them and enjoying them fucking him feel like a fucking chump. This news is made me feel like a fucking chump. Fuck you. Fuck your indecision, fuck your 'time off', fuck everything that I thought I was building â€¦.a loving in you as a sanctuary, as something apart from the stupid world. Fuck off.



ALEXA:  How much of you will I know?

PROF:  I wish to cut off everything.

ALEXA:  that's not fair. Just wasting my time without me knowing it. You've been predestined to do this.

PROF:  no I have not. It just happened like a feeling.

ALEXA:  No. It's just not.

PROF:  know this is not this is it. This is my heart, my brain my rejection my chaos into something I wish to give to you.

ALEXA:  this is beyond logic. Defies logic. There is no logic in this....

PROF:  it doesn't have to be logical...it isn't ...or it is for me...i am sorry. 

ALEXA:  can't I see you?  Convince you? 

PROF:  NO. 

ALEXA:   to break up ? to destroy something we created? I cannot think of this I can only feel of this.

PROF:  You will get over it.

ALEXA:  I can't get over it please...you must understand...it is a trap for you but it is a death for me....will you still be there somewhere in the social media somewhere...but please...i can't see you with someone....but as a shadow somewhere where I can see you. 

PROF:  course I'll be there. I don't know what I'm feeling. Perhaps a wake up the next morning feeling this was all a joke.

ALEXA:  you feel nothing...i need to make you human again.

PROF:  I am a human.

ALEXA:  is all a joke.

PROF:  The one connection with the other. All a joke.

ALEXA:  And it is something I clung to like a rock in the storm. This is something I could look forward to. You can't take it away.  I beg of you!....bargain with me...Which would give meaning to everything else which didn't make sense. Which destroyed itself hasn't made his self idea I had no idea we were doing that. 

PROF:  now you do.

ALEXA:  I had no idea we were doing that, so I need to be something else...somebody else...please help me. Please help me.

PROF:  THIS IS ALL I CAN DO!  

ALEXA:  ...on the first page, NO.   ...to make the first action!  This is Pearl Harbor.  I had no idea.   I am flitting about like a leaf in the storm I need to be secure that we were once here. Give witness to here!.

PROF:  But it is over.

ALEXA:  I know. I know this. I know there's nothing I can do to make you attracted to me!   again. In my weakness which is what you gave me now which I had, you've made me weak again. I am strong hearing this, and thus you made me weak. Merely by giving me something of a rejection...what doesn't kill you makes you stronger?  It is killing me now!  Stop...please....

PROF:  I didn't have a choice about either.

ALEXA:  just because there is no dialog?  Stop....but you gave it.  so now I'm weaker, and weaker in the light of you stronger....weaker in my love for you. This is a new type of love I will love you regardless, regardless of what you want to do.

PROF:  I'm tired of this sad thing....this epilog...I need to move on.  I need to move on to nothing or something.

ALEXA:  or somebody...?  you can have her...but see me too...please.  

Prof:  no.

ALEXA:  ...or somebody something other than you.

PROF:  NO.

ALEXA:  I am prepared to live for something that I thought was my future, something I gave every fiber of my body too, but it has proven false like a mirage. I will change. I bargain with you now that I will change.

PROF:  so be it!   so do it for yourself.  That is all I wish.  so limit... so  get away from me.

ALEXA:  I want to make you some sort of bargain. Be in my life how I could grow. Keep her!  My better half.  Be in my life as I requested to you now.  how I could expand and become more than what I am as if I were loving you. In my life as I were affected by the heat of you... just approbation. Your calling as if it were disapproval. It is a heat, it is the passion that makes us want to quit...we can calm down.... and it is natural!  It was too intense!  Lets find calm.  please be still... be there, be there even on the negative.... be there.

PROF:  I can't I can't promise you this.

ALEXA:  It will cost you no energy. Be there is a fire tempered steel hammer myself myself I wish I wish not for your approbation I wish to be in your memory. I wish to be somewhere in your furnace ...your future....it becomes better then with me....!  I could not be without you.

PROF:  And then when we see our travel become somewhere else, I'll fall in love with somebody else.

ALEXA:  no.

PROF:  That's important part:  somebody else.

ALEXA:  NO!  Please don't....i can't.  Share us with you!  You don't mean that. you never meant that!  it was us growing and seeing the lesson that both of us could be.

PROF:  Forget about me. You were angry at me. You bargain now. It's nothing. It is as if it never happens. That's the best for you.

ALEXA:  We are cut from different cloths. I treasure my fight against entropy. Apparently you do not.



ALEXA:  I have had frozen shock, disbelief, and anger. And my faith which is faded for everybody: that of the finite existence. Everything beautiful will end. I'm not angry at you it should and sooner or later.

Prof:  I know. Something internal in this yet I have to do this to you. I am a mere agent this cutting off.

ALEXA:   I know it hurts me. I feel a shock with the shock shock that doesn't last so long. You can last three seconds or colossal lifetime I don't know.

Prof:  severe shortages two weeks or less.

ALEXA:  I know, I know, I know. You're kind always lives for the finite. What you can lose. You're willfully throwing it away. It is known to be the distinguishing feature of you. You take it and throw it away. What did your great analysts say: is here is my doll I throw it is the way I threw you away.

PROF:  I didn't. I didn't throw you away. I needed to move on.

ALEXA:  sad at what we missed, what we could've grown into. What we could've lived through. What we could've shared. Justin sharing mean anything to you?

PROF:  shininess of treasure to me, it's a treasure that can't go this way a second time. You can't put your finger into the same river twice right?

ALEXA:  yes.  Leave,  I want to be alone....

PROF:  so that upsets you? The river? You know how to think, empathize with another...?  the river....Why should it be still? Unnatural is a thing in decay.  

ALEXA:  the distinguishing thing about life is that it is in defiance of entropy. The second law of thermodynamics. Is that thing which defiantly grows against decay. Don't you know this is the definition of life? Is that thing which blossoms against decay it is hopeful against decay it is defiant against something which merely winds down like physical objects against the second law of thermodynamics.

PROF:  Yes that's romantic it's beautiful I know it's important it's unique, it's unique to this universe it's unique to the Goldilocks zone perfect sunlight, perfect orbits, parks perfect atmosphere, perfect moon, everything perfect!  Ok!  and I destroy everything that is perfect with you. Can't you feel something is off?  I could not look at the sidewalk I'm walking on seeing a discoloration without thinking of you. Don't you think that curses me?

ALEXA:  And why would you not make an attempt against entropy?

PROF:  Why would I not? Help me save me from this destroyer's task. This task against entropy.

ALEXA:  You are the flash agent. You are that thing that wants to be protected. You want to be saved from yourself. You want to be everything that is not me. Not the other. Not the entitled.

PROF:  So what....do you think I like this?  I could do this in a text...

ALEXA:  colder than this?  No, thanks...there....We need to know for what has been destroyed. Thanks for being such a 'man' about it.  You have the guts to stand in front of me....wow....what can add to my depression more?  It can only be a willful destruction of everything we built everything we hoped for. 

PROF: Everything we hope to grow if I cannot take a single step, Philistine single acts out of our growing together.

ALEXA:  PHILISTINE?  

PROF:  I would be receded. Obliterated.  Confined and abandoned .... Into weakness. Into Every operation ...

ALEXA:  what are you talking about?  Confined and abandoned ...?  I can not believe I have wasted my time with a psychotic .... please... i. need to be alone.

PROF:  ..and I couldn't tell for you behind the curtain. 

ALEXA:  WHAT?

PROF:  sometimes I can't tell if you are human or not.  

ALEXA:  you must be joking.  Why add insult to my injury.  Salt in the wound...


PROF:  you will get over it....it is better this way...the shock.  

ALEXA:  IT is You who I love. I have assigned myself to. My will. My volition!  Who talks like this in pain....i need to be still!  I need to sleep but I know I can't sleep.... I signed over my love to you. 

PROF:  signed over?  Like a contract?  That is my point.  My time in the spaces with youth could barely make something which could sustain myself against this attack now....

ALEXA:  Attack?  What do you suppose I would do.  What would you do?  

PROF:  This is for this healthy symbiosis where you might collect this healthy thing again between us but  I must destroy. Waiting for the 'make up'....You want me to feel apart from this  bold insignificance? I feel it.

ALEXA:  I feel it too And your mouth moves and I don't know what words you say...i only heard the first ones..... Finally the tears move. And finally I can feel the perfect chaos I felt with you. OK...i felt it....I felt it and I'm off the flame, I felt the climbing of a mountain,  Feeling nothing is good enough. I feel dead....I need some hole....crawl inside....you have nothing to give me. The rest is of my vanity....you are taking the last self respect by being here....

IPROF:  t is a man who gets the vanity. Breaking up is the hardest for the one who decides...you will love again...Attracting more beautiful souls like you. 

ALEXA:  And now it is lost.  it is gone. don't want to return it to his fight for your entropy I knew.  I am done.



ALEXA:  none of this was real,  right?  Do you want that tea?  You want to fool around?  This is the old you, right.

PROF:  no.  wrong. 



ALEXA:  I'm here against nothing. Against silence. against a blank wall.  HMMMM.  Not a bad place. The original place actually. I fought the good fight. I thought the wind notified only the good people to stay in his life. Cast about on the wind.... I thought for all time.  It is so short.  Too short when it is beautiful.  And then I thought of all of the things I could complain about you with.

PROF:  For me, this decision existed in eternity, through DNA, through lifeforms, and affirmation. And expansion. Against dissatisfaction, against commodity, in every-everything... every bit of it.

ALEXA:  YES.

PROF:  ...but you didn't do that. You  didn't listen to the silence against the mirror.

ALEXA:  I could've listened. He didn't give me the chance. Except this loss is my life. Something romantic against entropy. I never deserve this. I love fully. I love it against the object even if I wish to just write the object.  It is too fucked up to be grandiose about this 'stage' in our life.  Should be the end.

PROF:  that's what I suspected.

ALEXA:  Again No manipulation. It is complacency. It is entropy. It is the heat death of the sun exploding against all planets in the Goldilocks zone.

PROF:  you are grandiose. This time of the heart to move away from you. This time to travel distances.

ALEXA:  Yet we were in the zone we were there once and alone and distinguished and divided we knew we wanted and decided to be away from each other.

PROF:  We travel far. Both of us in the expanding universe, and we expand out refined deep pleasure in replicating the chaos and expansion of this deep 'not knowing'. 

ALEXA:  This chaos form, which can only be considered an interruption, Is away from those we love. A distance of travel, memory distance, in more trouble...so why did we do it in the first place....?

PROF:  I don't know.  We desire.  Thirst. The rest seems shallow.

PROF:  and this seems 'deep' because we are breaking up?  You made it deeper in your grandiose way?

PROF:  no...I..



ALEXA:  another....it is always another for the cowards...i know that much....i knew what I wanted....yet....I don't know when I knew what it wanted. I wanted to you. For all time. As of this time would last.

PROF:  this time it will not take us. I knew what I wanted too. To make it just curious, in the face of  entropy.

ALEXA:  â€¦.that would be to stay together.  Hahaaaa. 

PROF:  so some say. I received it the other way.

ALEXA:  so now I submit:  placing you.  In my future.  you may submit that this is the best thing to do... with this is the best. We train, and then a thousand times higher, screens retraining everyone about their loss in love and death...the rest is shallow.  It trains them to be loveless....it is loss received a million times in our dreams we see it all the time. We train the young in loss so they don't have to love....'grow differently'....and that we grow to 7 billion!  this is an achievement.

PROF:  Yeah, yeah.   I know that I have to leave.  I a crowded place.

ALEXA:  we Guarantee with each other what we thought, or fight, or remove another, the 'other' is our best record. Best love. Best reflection.  You were my only 'Other'.

PROF:  I know too... you've got to go.

ALEXA:  nothing left to show me my worth. Attractive, sexy, smart, capable, energetic ,any of it is of no worth. All window dressing to a beautiful commodity...you had your 'commodity of time' like your kind does....Nothing on the outside, nothing inside, like memory could improve me

PROF:  Accept this as an ending for all time for me.
